This is the Softuni Javascript advanced course.
In this course no HTML and CSS was coded by me, the files were the problems, the .js files are my solutions.
In the problems where the goal was "Unit testing" only the test were writen by me.
For further information about the problems - https://judge.softuni.org/Contests#!/List/ByCategory/304/JS-Advanced.
Course instance - May 2022.
